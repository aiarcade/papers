online learning and late fusion techniques with multiple image features.
We extract conventional Fisher Vectors (FV) [Sanchez et al., CVPR 2011] and streamlined version of Graphical Gaussian Vectors (GGV) [Harada, NIPS 2012]. For extraction, we use not only common SIFT and CSIFT, but also LBP and GIST in a dense-sampling manner.
We train linear classifiers using Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm [Crammer et al., JMLR 2006].

In this submission, image classification was performed using a conventional pipeline based on Fisher vector image representation and one-vs-rest linear SVM classifiers. In more detail, two types of local patch features were densely extracted over multiple scales: SIFT and colour statistics. The features were then augmented with patch spatial coordinates and aggregated into two Fisher vectors corresponding to the two feature types. Fisher vectors were computed using GMMs with 1024 Gaussians, resulting in 135K-dimensional representations. To obtain a single feature vector per image, the two Fisher vectors were then stacked. We did not use spatial pyramid representation.
