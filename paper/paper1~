The latest attempt in image classification with an error 5.98% in ImageNet data set is reported by  Ren Wu et al.[ref] of Baidu research.
They developed an end to end deep learning  system named Deep Image. It uses a highly optimized parallel algorithm  to implement large deep neural network with augmented input data. The network is trained using stochastic gradient decent algorithms (SGD)[ref]. Parallelism strategies used in their network is
