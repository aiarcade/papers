These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an inﬁnite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these “Stepped Sigmoid Units” are unchanged. They can be approximated eﬃciently by noisy, rectiﬁed linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face veriﬁcation on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.

abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation
algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based
learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture,
gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex
decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as
handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews
various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and
compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task.
Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal
with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other
techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of
multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition,
and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer
networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally
using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance
measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described.
Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the
flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network
for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional
neural network character recognizers combined with global training
techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.
It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

@article{He2014,
abstract = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g. 224x224) input image. This requirement is "artificial" and may hurt the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with a more principled pooling strategy, "spatial pyramid pooling", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. By removing the fixed-size limitation, we can improve all CNN-based image classification methods in general. Our SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the datasets of ImageNet 2012, Pascal VOC 2007, and Caltech101. The power of SPP-net is more significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method computes convolutional features 30-170x faster than the recent leading method R-CNN (and 24-64x faster overall), while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007.},

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This "pyramid match" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches},

The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

@misc{Haralick1973,
abstract = {Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying onject or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 pancromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispectral imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decisions rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for photomicrographs, 82 percent for aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification application.},
