\section{Simultaneous Localization And Mapping(SLAM) }
Estimating the vehicle position and surrounding map  is a necessary condition to achieve autonomous driving. There are multiple sensors like LIDAR, RADAR, Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU), GPS and the stereo Camera are  used to obtain a surrounding map. A navigational map  is obtained by fusing the data from these  sensors.\\

\subsection{Generic Methods}
Following are the commonly used sensor fusion algorithms used in SLAM.\\

\subsection{Visual SLAM(VSLAM)}
Instead of using high cost sensors such as LIDAR, VSLAM techniques uses camera as the basic sensor.

\section{Motion Planning}

Map obtained from a SLAM algorithm is used to plan the motion of the vehicle through the given GPS waypoints. Some of the algorithms used to  plan the motion of an autonomous vehicle is given below.\\

\section{Object detection, recognition and scene understanding}
Object recognition algorithms are used to understand the objects/obstacles  around the vehicle. The primary obstacle avoidance methods are based on the point clouds generated from the LIDAR and RADAR data.  But the object recognition methods are more rely on the visual sensors such as camera. Majority of the algorithms uses supervised  machine learning methods to recognize the object. Some of the widely used methods are listed below.\\
